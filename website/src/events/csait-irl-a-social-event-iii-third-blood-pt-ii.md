\*\* **We've just opened up our Discord server -** [**click here to join**](https://discord.gg/6HhEKmbWf2) **\*\***

_Look out! The New Developers’ CSAIT IRL Social is coming!_ \
Right at the end of exam week.

__

**_“But Andrew, we can’t gather for a social… can we?”_**

We’re TND! We’re doing it ONLINE, man!!!\
We set up a new Discord server with 600 billion rooms for us to play in!

__

**_“But we’ll miss seeing the profs. We’ll miss Brian Minaji telling Andrew he’s old and stuff…”_**

The profs are coming, too! We’ll all be drinking & dancing at Club Discord.\
And get this: when it’s time for Brian to burn Andrew, they’ll be live on [our Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/thenewdevelopers).

__

**_"But Andrew, I can't be partying right now! I have to look for a job!!"_**

WHY NOT DO BOTH??!?!?!

We'll be inviting industry guests from Hamilton-based tech companies to have a drink with us that night - that means CEOs, CTOs, senior devs, and hiring managers from places like Weever Apps, Ackroo, and Reliq Health (we'll keep you updated on who says yes!). We'll be bringing them on our live stream to introduce them to you, but then they'll be free to mingle in our Discord server (psst! THIS WOULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THEM HOW TO GET HIRED THERE).

__

**_“Wait. If you have the TND Twitch stream going, that means you guys can stream one of your amazing playlists of funky, funky songs like you always do!"_**

We'll do you one better...\
WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIVE DJs!\
No LOCKdown is gonna stop us from GETTIN’ down!!!

YEEEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!

Here's a link to [our Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thenewdevelopers), and we'll be updating this page with an invite link to our Discord server as soon as it's ready - so keep an eye on this page!!!
