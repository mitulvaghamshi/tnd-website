Waddap everyoooone! Every semester (except the summer), we rent out The Cellar and order a bunch of nachos and put on some sick tunes and [Andrew](https://thenewdevelopers.com/about) tells some hilarious jokes and just in general we get away from our computers and actually interface with one-another for a pretty good time.

Of course with \*waves at everything\* we can't do the whole physical thing this time, but the Social's become something special over the past year and we'd really like to keep the tradition alive. 

So, our plan is to take over a small part of the CSAIT Discord server where we'll set up a bunch of voice channels so people can split off and chat, and we'll have some online games set up as well as a Twitch stream going so we can bring in some of the instructors to introduce themselves (and also grill them with hard-hitting questions - for instance, \[please insert funny joke here]). 

We'll start streaming at 6:30pm and wrap up around 9:00pm, but will leave the channels up for another day or so in case people want to hang around. It'll be like a bar that has a last-call but is pretty chill about it so you stay on and then suddenly it's 5am and you might as well head down to the waterfront to catch the sunrise.

No need to register, but if you don't have a link to the Discord server shoot us an email at newdevelopers@mohawkcollege.ca and we'll send you one.
